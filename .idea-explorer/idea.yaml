  title: "\u201CDo You Mean\u2026?\u201D: Fixing User Intent Without Annoying Them"
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Autocomplete and intent detection systems often incorrectly correct
    users in ways that alter their original intent. Evaluating whether model rewrites
    preserve user intent is necessary, and it may be possible to design a method that
    improves clarification behavior without overwhelming users with excessive questions.

  background:
    description: "Autocomplete and intent detection systems can be helpful or infuriating.\
      \ How often do models incorrectly \u201Ccorrect\u201D users in a way that changes\
      \ the intent? Can we evaluate intent preservation: when the model rewrites a\
      \ query or instruction, does it keep the user\u2019s goal? And can we design\
      \ a method that improves clarification behavior without spamming questions?"
